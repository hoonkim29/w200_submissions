    "- Demonstrate outputting useful information to the user in the correct format\n",

    "## General Guidelines:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Even though your final submission must be individual .py files, it may be helpful to first solve the problems in this jupyter notebook, then translate the files into .py form.  A coding cell is provided for each problem to facilitate this.\n",
    "- Please format your input and output strings to be user friendly.  For tips on how to do this, see the python string formatting cookbook at: https://mkaz.blog/code/python-string-format-cookbook/.  For example, in the first problem below, format the tip to two decimal places like 15.25 instead of 15.25000001.\n",
    "- Limited user input validation and error checking is encouraged on this assignment. Each question below will indicate the type of input that you can expect. (for example, if the question states the input will be an integer you can expect the user to input an integer and do not need to check to ensure it is an integer versus a float or a string)\n",
    "- Adding comments in your code is strongly suggested but won't be graded.\n",
    "- The examples given are samples of how we will test/grade your code. Please ensure your scripts output the same information.\n",
    "- If you are stuck on a problem or do not understand a question - please come to office hours or ask questions to the class Google group (please don't post your code though). If it is a coding problem send a private email to all of the instructors at: mids-python-instructors@googlegroups.com.\n",
    "- We also have a TA tutor for extra help and 1 on 1 sessions!\n",
    "- Hints are given in some of the questions; these are optional so you do NOT need to use the hint (or code your answer that way) as long as your code meets the requirements of the problem.\n",
    "- You may use any libraries from the Python Standard Library for this assignment: https://docs.python.org/3/library/"

You cannot use the 'reverse' function or the string slicing [::-1] method for this problem! You should use s.lower() and s.upper(), as appropriate, to change the string to lowercase and print it out with only the first letter of the reversed word in uppercase. If the name is the same forward and backwards, print \"Palindrome!\" on the next line. Make sure your code prints the sample examples exactly as shown below.\n",
